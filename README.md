The purpose of this is not only to create a "Resume site" but also to explore and learn some old-fashioned web development along the way using just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Eventually, once I have considered this website to be finished, I plan to work on a more modern approach for a second version. I am still debating what I would like to use, but I am currently considering React.
