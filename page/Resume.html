                It is my continual mission to learn new concepts, languages, and anything computer science - every day. Things change and are created so quickly these days that it is nearly impossible to stay up-to-date and proficient in it all. However, this is not a reason to become overwhelmed or not to try! I don't want to just specialize in one sub-field of computer science, I want to have a wide knowledge base of the most important, powerful, widespread and impactful techniques, languages, or whatever else may come. It is more valuable, in my opinion, to be <a href="https://innolution.com/resources/glossary/t-shaped-skills" target="_blank">T-shaped</a>, with a broad skillset and a few specialties, than to paint yourself in a corner focusing on specializing in one specific skill. I will be continually updating this page to add whichever skills I've picked up, as well as updating my resume, which will be available for download below. As for what I am currently working on learning, you can find a list with a brief description of each on my <a href="./Goals.html">Goals</a> page.
