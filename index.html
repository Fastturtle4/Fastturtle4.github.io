                I am due to graduate with a major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics in Spring of 2019. I am most proficient in C, C++, and Python, with additional knowledge of various other languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, PHP, and SQL, in order from most to least knowledge. Though I do not have any work experience yet in a computer science related job, I believe that I would be an asset to any potential employer as I am always trying to invest in myself with personal projects, research into new languages and ideas, and a passion for computer science. I try to do some amount of coding every day, whether it be on a project for school or for personal edification purposes. I believe that with constant effort and determination I can excel on anything I work on.
